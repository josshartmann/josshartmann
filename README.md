## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Josias Hartmann, a dedicated programmer and lifelong learner.

### Professional Journey

ðŸ’¼ With a strong foundation in the world of finance, I have successfully navigated the intricate landscape of the financial markets. Over the years, I've honed my analytical skills, developed a deep understanding of data-driven decision-making, and cultivated a passion for technology.

ðŸ’» My journey then led me into the realm of software development, where I embraced the role of a backend developer and problem solver.

### Transitioning to Data

ðŸ“Š While my background lies in backend development, I'm excited to share that I'm now on a new path. I have a deep interest in data-related fields, especially in building the infrastructure and technology behind data-intensive architectures. My goal is to leverage my programming skills to excel as a data engineer.

### Portfolio

Here's a brief showcase of some of my noteworthy repositories:

1. **Northwind ETL Pipeline** - This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The data is sourced from CSV files and a PostgreSQL database schema representing the Northwind database. It was developed as a code challenge for Indicium.

2. **Football Data Import and Table Relationships in PostgreSQL** - This project showcases a Python script in a Jupyter Notebook that imports football data from CSV files into PostgreSQL tables and establishes relationships between the tables. It utilizes pandas for data reading, psycopg2 for database connection, and SQLAlchemy for interaction with the database. The football data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset: International Football Results from 1872 to 2023.

3. **Data Transformation and for Foreign Trade** - This repository contains Python code and a VBA script that enable the transformation and styling of foreign trade data obtained from the database detailed by NCM (Mercosur Common Nomenclature).

4. **Coinmarketcap Spider** - This is a Scrapy spider project designed to scrape data from the CoinMarketCap website. The spider extracts information about cryptocurrencies' names, symbols, and values from the top section of the website. It then iterates over all the pages to collect data from each page.
